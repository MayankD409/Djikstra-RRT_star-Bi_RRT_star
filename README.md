# Path Planning with Dijkstra's Algorithm

This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm for path planning in a grid-based environment. The algorithm finds the shortest path between a start and a goal point while avoiding obstacles.

## Features

- Dijkstra's algorithm implementation
- Visualization of explored nodes and final path using Pygame
- Customizable start and goal points
- Support for different types of obstacles
- Simple user interface for inputting start and goal points

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
https://github.com/MayankD409/Dijkstra_Point_Robot.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Execute the python Script:
```
cd Dijkstra_Point_Robot/
python3 dijkstra.py
```

## Usage

1. Run the main script.

2. Follow the instructions to input the start and goal points.

3. View the visualization of the explored nodes and final path in the Pygame window.
